# Wine-Data-Analysis
Uses R to find what determines a better tasting wine. Identifies what variables are best and worst in rating a wine. 

Are data set contains 6497 observations and has 12 variables.

The specifics of what each variables’ information contains is below.

Description of attributes:

1 - fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)

2 - volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste

3 - citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add ‘freshness’ and flavor to wines

4 - residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it’s rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet

5 - chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine

6 - free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine

7 - total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine

8 - density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content

9 - pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale

10 - sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant

11 - alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine

Output variable (based on sensory data): 12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

13 - Type: indicates type of wine(Red or White)

14- Taste: indicates the grading of how good the wine tasted in all factors
